I have a great interest in nano-materials and making sensors using nano-materials to detect toxic gases. it is not possible for a single gas detector to sense each kind of toxic gas.  Currently as my college project i am working on making an electrode using nano-silica to detect the arsenic content in water.
For detection of toxic gases like SO2, NH3, CO, use of Carbon nanotubes can be implemented. Using photoemission spectroscopy, whenever carbon nanotubes is exposed to these gases, a very visible change in the photoemission feature of the carbon is observed. A similar kind of experiment was done by Goldoni to detect toxic gases using Single Walled Carbon nanotubes.
I would like to work and learn in the field of nano-materials and nanotechnology during my fellowship. I look forward to enhance and gain more knowledge in the field of nano-materials. I have intermediate knowledge in Programming languages like C++ and i am proficient with tools and softwares like ASPEN and MATLAB, along with the knowledge of using microcomputers like Arduino and raspberryPi that can be paired with a sensor that can be used to detect toxic gases. I look forward to use this knowledge to complete a fully working application that can be used to detect toxic gases.
